      "Adze Fitness Studio began when a handful of trainers turned their garage sessions into a family-style movement. Madipakkam needed a premium gym that felt human — where neighbours become teammates and coaching is rooted in empathy.",
      "We believe transformation is a group effort. Every class, every check-in, every celebration is designed to build confidence, consistency, and character.",
      "Adze is not just a gym. It’s a movement powered by real people showing up for each other."],
